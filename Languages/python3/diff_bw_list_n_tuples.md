# List
* List are just like the arrays, declared in other languages. 
* Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python. 
* In Python, the list is a type of container in Data Structures, which is used to store multiple data at the same time. 
* Lists are a useful tool for preserving a sequence of data and further iterating over it.

# Tuple
* Tuple is also a sequence data type that can contain elements of different data types, but these are immutable in nature. 
* In other words, a tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. 
* The tuple is faster than the list because of static in nature.

# Diff

* Implication of iterations is Time-consuming.Implication of iterations is comparatively Faster

* The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements

* Lists consume more memory. Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list

* Lists have several built-in methods. Tuple does no have must built-in methods.

* The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur. In tuple, it is hard to take place.
