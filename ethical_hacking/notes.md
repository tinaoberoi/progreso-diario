# Network Hacking

## Networking Basics:

## What is MAC Address and How to change it ?
* Mac : Media Access Control
* Permanent, Unique and Physical address
* assigned to network interfaces by the device manufacturer.
* So it is wireless/internet card each come with a unique address, thus no tw devices in the world have same mac address.
* This address will remain same irrespective of if you connect it to any device.
* Since IP address is used in the internet to idenify computers and communicate with the devices on the internet.
* Similarly MAC address is used within the network to identify devices and transfer data between devices.
* So each packet being transfered contains a source mac and destination mac.

**Why change MAC address ?**
* Since it is unique as is used to identify devices, changing it will make you **anonymous**.
* Impersonate other devices
* Bypass filters

**NOTE**: If you change the MAC address, once you retstart the computer the changes will disappear (because we are only changing the MAC address in memory and noot the physical mac address)
