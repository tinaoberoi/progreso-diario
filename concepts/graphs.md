# Graphs
* Tree is connected and graphs its not necesary
* Tree has no cycles
* There is always atleast one way to reach fro one node to another
* Tree is special type of graph
* degree in Graph : no of edges through that vertex
* Connected graph : for every 2 vertices there is always a path (need not to be direct)
* Connected components: When a graph is not connected, then the set of connected nodeset is connected components. When it will be a connected graph, only 1 connected components = graph itself.
* Tree is connected graph with no cycles.
* Minimum connected graph = tree
* N nodes, min edges in graph = 0. Min edges in a connected graph = n-1.
* In a complete graph nC2 edges.
* Min edges order O(n), and max edges order O(n2)
* So if an algorithm is O(E), that means it is O(n2)
