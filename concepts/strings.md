# String
* A subsequence is a sequence generated froma string after deleting some characters of string without changing the order of remaining string characters.
* A string of length n will have 2^(n) subsequences
* Substring is the contiguous part of string. If there is a string of length n, then its number of substrings are n*(n+1)/2.
* For example, If we have a string : "abc", Then its substrings are :- "a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc"
