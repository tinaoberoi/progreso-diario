####1626B- Minor Reduction

In question
######### take two neighboring digits in ùë• and replace them with their sum without leading zeros

Brute Force:
Have a var max_no generated = -1
Find sum of every adjacent number, form number from the remaining and sum, which is curr_no
 if max_no < curr no, curr_no = max_no


Logic: There can be two cases when you get the sum
       1. Sum >= 10 , the number of digits do not reduce
       2. Sum<10, number of digits reduce
In every case the number formed < original number
- To have the largest number we should try to find if sum >=10
For all such cases too, we should have the ones with rightmost index (since they will reduce the least)
- If all adjacent no sum<10, number of digits will definite decrease by one,
To maximise the sum to be replaced should be leftmost. Since that number formed will be the biggest.

        int curr_sum = (s[i]-'0')+(s[i+1]-'0');
        if(curr_sum >= 10){
            index = i;
            //cout<<"curr_sum="<<curr_sum<<" index="<<i<<endl;
        }
