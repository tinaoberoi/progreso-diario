##### 1626A Equidistant Letters
 Since in problem “rearrange the letters in the string in such a way that for each pair of letters that appear exactly twice, the distance between the letters in the pair is the same”

Logic: Only req is repeated letters should have same Dist, what if the distance is 1. That is they are placed next to each other.

Ans: sort the letters in string 

```

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
using li = long long;

int solve(){
    string s;
    cin>>s;
    sort(s.begin(), s.end());
    cout<<s<<endl;
    return 0;
}


int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}

```
