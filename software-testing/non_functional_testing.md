# Non-Functional Testing

An excellent example of non-functional test would be to check how many people can simultaneously login into a software. Other ex:
- All web images should have alt tags (Accessibility testing)
- Software should be installable on all versions of Windows and Mac	(Compatibility Testing)
- Application load time should not be more than 5 secs up to 1000 users accessing it simultaneously	(Performance Testing)

Compatability Testing and System testing mixes up :-(
