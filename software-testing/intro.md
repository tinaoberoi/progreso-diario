# Software Testing
* Identify corectness, completeness and quality of developed computer sotware.
* Finding errors to be fixed before release. (making ti defect-free)

## Types of software testing:
* Functional (unit-testing, integration testing, etc.)
* Performance (Performace, Load, Scalability, etc)
* Maintainence (Regression and Maintainence)

## Princliples of Testing
* Testing shows presence of defects
* Exhaustive testing is impossible
* Early Testing
* Defect Clustering
* Pesticide Paradox
* Testing is context dependent
* Absence of errors - fallacy

Development models selected for a project, depends on aims and goal of that project

## Waterfal Model
(SDLC Software Deveopment Life Cycle)
Requirements -> Design -> Build -> Test -> Maintainence

Drawback: Testing after development.

## V-Model
(SDLC and STLC)
Testing goes side by side

## Phases of STLC
- Requirement Analysis (Types of tests to be performed, identify testing env, etc)
- Test Planning (effort and cost estimates of project, test tool selection, etc)
- Test case development (create test cases, test case data, etc)
- Test Environment setup 
- Test Execution
- Test Cycle closure
