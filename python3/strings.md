# Strings

## Slicing

* syntax: [start: stop : step]
* stop index is not including but upto

## Strings are non mutable

* Strings are not mutable! (meaning you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string)
* Cant change the string as in c++
* s[0] = 'somechar' gives error
* Solution: use slicing and concatenation

## Float formatting follows
 * {value:width.precision f}
