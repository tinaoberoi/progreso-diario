# Methods in python3

* Methods are functions built into objects.
* Methods perform specific actions on object and can also take arguments.
* Eg: object.method(arg1,arg2,etc...)
* methods can have an argument 'self' referring to the object itself.
## Some common Methods on list: 
* append() allows us to add elements to the end of a list:
```python
lst.append(1)
``` 
* The count() method will count the number of occurrences of an element in a list.
```python
lst.count(2)
```
