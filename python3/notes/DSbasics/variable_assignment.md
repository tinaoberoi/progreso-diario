# Variable Assignment in Python3

## Variable Rules in Python3
* Names of var cannot start with number
* No spaces in Name, use '_' instead
* Cant use any symbols :'",<>/?|\!@#%^&*~-+
* Best practice *names lowercase* 
* Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), 
   or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
* Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"

## Important Points
* Python uses dynamic typing, (reassign variables to different data types)
* Pros of Dynamic Typing: very easy to work with, fast
* Cons of Dynamic Typing: diffi cult to debug, yo need to be aware of type()
* To know type of var use type()
* The different types of variables include : int, float, str, bool, dict, list, tuple, set
